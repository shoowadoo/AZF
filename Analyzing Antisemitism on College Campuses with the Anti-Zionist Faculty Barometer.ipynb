    "Since the October 7th terrorist attack on Israel by Palestinians, antisemitism and anti-Zionism has spread like wildfire throughout the world. One place where antisemitism has skyrocketed in recent years is on American college campuses. This alarming spread has been linked to the group \"Faculty for Justice in Palestine\" (FJP), which has over 170 chapters across the U.S. Behind the creation of this faculty group is the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI), a group linked to five U.S. designated terrorist organizations including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to combat the spread of antisemitism on American college campuses, the AMCHA Initiative recently released the Anti-Zionist Faculty (AZF) Barometer. This comprehensive, one-of-a-kind tool was designed to help people \"evaluate the pervasiveness of anti-Zionist faculty at hundreds of U.S. colleges and universities.\" Schools with active FJP chapters report higher rates of violent antisemitic activity, making the group's presence a significant factor in a university's AZF Barometer ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we will explore this fascinating new tool via data analysis in a Jupyter Notebook. To do so, we will first collect relevant data from the AMCHA Initiative website via web scraping. We will then prepare the scraped data in a way that allows us to explore the data and to start asking interesting questions. Finally, we will do some basic statistics on the data in order to demonstrate the extent of antisemitism on college campuses in America."

      "The Anti-Zionist Faculty (AZF) Barometer provides a ranking system to measure the presence and activity of anti-Zionist faculty on U.S. college campuses. AMCHA Initiative’s research shows a strong correlation between anti-Zionist faculty presence and the severity of campus antisemitism, including physical assaults, threats, and harassment targeting Jewish students.\n",
      "The rise of Faculty for Justice in Palestine (FJP), a network of over 170 campus chapters established after Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack, has exacerbated this issue. FJP was launched in response to a call from the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, and members are encouraged to use their academic positions and departmental resources to actively promote the academic boycott of Israel (academic BDS) by engaging in actions to purge their campuses of Zionism and Zionists. Campuses with active FJP chapters experience higher rates of violent antisemitic activity, making their presence a critical factor in the AZF Barometer.\n",
      "The AZF Barometer ranks over 700 colleges and universities on a scale from 0 (Negligible) to 5 (Extreme) based on four measures of anti-Zionist faculty presence and activity: publicly available data on faculty academic boycotters (through October 31, 2024), departmental anti-Zionist statements (through October 31, 2024), FJP chapter presence (through October 31, 2024), and FJP events or statements from October 7, 2023, to June 30, 2024.\n",
      "These rankings - updated annually - can help students, families, and stakeholders evaluate how welcoming or hostile a campus may be for Jewish or pro-Israel students and advocate for administrative and legislative measures to counter faculty misuse of their positions to promote antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Rankings Include: \n",
      "Extreme (5)\n",
      "(Critical level of anti-Zionist faculty presence/activity found)\n",
      "Severe (4)\n",
      "(High anti-Zionist faculty presence/activity found)\n",

    "We might also be interested in exploring the presence of anti-Zionist faculty in a particular state, e.g., Florida. A simple way we can do this is by extracting all schools with the word 'Florida' (for instance) from our dataframe. (Indeed, there are better methods, as this will potentially leave out schools that do not have the state's name in them). To do so, we create a new dataframe `florida` with the same column header names, but this time we only add rows with the word 'Florida' in column `College/University`. We do this below, and then inspect the dataframe. "
